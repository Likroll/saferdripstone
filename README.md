# Safer Dripstone
Make it so that dripstone with a height of one doesn't have increased damage, normal fall damage still applies.

Only required on the server, however, the client will still hear the normal noise, installing the mod on both sides will fix this.

#### Backport?
Making a backport to would be pretty simple and easy, I'm just lazy. <br>
If you want one just make an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/Likroll/saferdripstone) and I'll get around to it... at some point.
